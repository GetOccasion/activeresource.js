### Master

* **Breaking:** Switched from `jQuery.ajax` to `axios`, which have different promise interfaces
* **Breaking:** Switched all references of `attribute` in `errors()` object to `field`:
  * `error.attribute` is now `error.field`
  * `resource.errors().forField(field)` returns a collection of errors where `field.startsWith(field)`
  * `resource.errors().forAttribute(attribute)` is now `resource.errors().detailsForField(field)`
* **Potentially breaking:** Fixed the incorrect `Content-Type` in default request interface (`JsonApi`)
  * Original: `application/json`
  * Correct: `application/vnd.api+json`
* Switch to new build system using `grunt-umd` package instead of `grunt-umd_wrapper`
* Pad `/` on bad URL references to remove ill formatting of query URLs
* Fix bug in relationship link name being camelCased in `JsonApi` interface
* Add `resourceLibrary.strictAttributes` boolean config option. If true, only attributes defined in `klass().attributes()` will
  be in the result of `resource.attributes()`. If false, any non-function properties of the resource will be returned.
* Add `afterRequest` callback that is called after GET, POST, PATCH, PUT requests of a resource
  * `afterBuild` will be called on GET, but it is called before any fields are assigned to the resource
* Add source maps
* Fix bug in array processing in `Interfaces.JsonApi#toCamelCase` and `toUnderscored`
* Use a single instance of `axios` in interfaces, so that `resourceLibrary.interface.axios.request` can be easily stubbed
* Fix bug in Interfaces.JsonApi#toCamelCase that mishandles attributes with arrays of strings as the value
* Add pop and shift to Collection
* Fix JSON API interface sending invalid relationship data format when relationship assigned to null
