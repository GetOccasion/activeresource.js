## Welcome to ActiveResource.js

### A Javascript ORM for consuming your API backend with ease

ActiveResource.js is designed to make interacting with resources stored on a RESTful server more straightforward and holistic than simpler solutions like ngResource. ActiveResource.js constructs and executes requests and formats responses into meaningful resource representations on the client side, allowing you to perform CRUD operations, as well as interact with and modify the various relationships (often known as associations) of resources effortlessly.
