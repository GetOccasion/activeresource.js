# Core methods and members for Base class
class ActiveResource::Core
  # The name to use when constantizing on the client
  # @example 'Product'
  #
  # @note On a production server where minification occurs, the actual name of classes
  #   `@constructor.name` will change from `Product` to perhaps `p`. But, since a class
  #   is added as a variable to its resource library (or its prototype), we can use this
  #   method to determine the name of the variable in the resource library scope
  # @className = ''

  # The name to use when querying the server for this resource
  # @example 'products'
  # @queryName = ''

  # The primary key by which to index this resource
  @primaryKey = 'id'

  # The interface to use when querying the server for this class
  @interface: ->
    @resourceLibrary.interface

  # The interface to use when querying the server for this resource
  interface: ->
    @klass().interface()

  # Creates a new ActiveResource::Relation with the extended queryParams passed in
  #
  # @param [Object] queryParams the extended query params for the relation
  # @return [ActiveResource::Relation] the new Relation for the extended query
  @__newRelation: (queryParams) ->
